# Neural Network Development Unity Project
 
This is my self-developed neural network which is developed from scratch by deriving formulas and implementing them in C#. Then I and designed created a UI in Unity and implemented using my neural network to solve some classic machine learning problems such as the XOR problem and digit recognization problem.

- Drived and developed a completely customizable neural network library in C# from scratch
- Developed UI and visualizations, and implmented different problems solving in Unity with my nearal network library
  - Nodes and weights of neural network are colored based on their values
  - Outputs and inputs are displayed and updated at runtime


## Current Version
Screen Recording for solving the XOR problem with a 2-4-1 sigmoid model (overfitting):

Another screenshot for solving the XOR problem with 2-4-1 sigmoid model at another instance (notice the variation from the recording):
